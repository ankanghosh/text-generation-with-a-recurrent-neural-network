# text-generation-with-a-recurrent-neural-network
Generating text using the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus dataset with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

# About the project
This Google Colab notebook demonstrates text generation using a character-based RNN and the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus dataset. The data undergoes preparation and preprocessing before being used to train an RNN-based model. Training is conducted across Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) cores using TensorFlowâ€™s distributed computing setup for TPUs. Starting with no prior knowledge of English words, the model learns to generate dialogue-like text after training. However, the generated text lacks a high degree of coherence, and potential next steps are identified to enhance the quality and coherence of the outputs.

# Tools Used
Tools and libraries used in this project include convokit, pandas, TensorFlow, and NumPy.

# Who can benefit from the project?
Anyone can use the project to get started with the basics of character-level text generation using TensorFlow.

# Getting Started
Anyone interested in getting started with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Natural Language Processing, specifically, character-level text generation with RNNs and TensorFlow, can clone or download the project to get started.
